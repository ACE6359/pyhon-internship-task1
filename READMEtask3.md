## ðŸ“Œ Python Tasks (17-24)
These are simple Python programming exercises that include:
1. **Multiplication Table** - Prints the multiplication table of a given number.
2. **Swap Two Numbers** - Swaps two numbers without using a third variable.
3. **Check Substring** - Checks if one string is a substring of another.
4. **Decimal to Binary** - Converts a decimal number into binary.
5. **Matrix Addition** - Adds two matrices of the same size.
6. **Matrix Multiplication** - Multiplies two matrices.
7. **Find Second Largest** - Finds the second largest number in a list.
8. **Check Anagram** - Determines if two strings are anagrams.

# Tic-Tac-Toe with AI (Minimax)

A Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game featuring an AI opponent that utilizes the minimax algorithm. This project provides a classic gaming experience where a human player (using symbol **O**) competes against an intelligent AI (using symbol **X**).

## Overview

This project implements a complete Tic-Tac-Toe game on a 3x3 grid. The AI leverages the minimax algorithm to evaluate all possible moves and select the optimal one. The game dynamically updates the board, checks for win conditions after each move, and gracefully handles draw scenarios.

## Features

- **Classic Gameplay:** Enjoy a traditional game of Tic-Tac-Toe with clear, printed board visualization.
- **Intelligent AI Opponent:** The AI employs the minimax algorithm to make challenging, optimal moves.
- **Real-Time Board Updates:** After every move, the current state of the game board is displayed.
- **Outcome Detection:** The program automatically detects and announces wins, losses, or draws.
- **User-Friendly Input:** The player is prompted to enter their move by specifying row and column indices (0-2).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3:** Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system. This project does not require any external libraries apart from Python's standard library.
