# Python Internship Task - 1

## Overview
This repository contains solutions for Task 1 assigned during my internship. The task involved solving various basic and intermediate-level Python exercises, including arithmetic operations, string manipulations, number checks, and encryption-decryption systems.

## Task Details
Here are the tasks and corresponding Python functions implemented in the project:

1. **Sum of Two Numbers**
   - Function: `sum_two_numbers(a, b)`
   - Takes two integers as input and returns their sum.

2. **Odd or Even Check**
   - Function: `odd_or_even(number)`
   - Determines if a given number is odd or even.

3. **Factorial Calculation**
   - Function: `factorial(n)`
   - Computes the factorial of a given number.

4. **Fibonacci Sequence**
   - Function: `fibonacci_sequence(n)`
   - Generates the first `n` numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

5. **Reverse a String**
   - Function: `reverse_string(s)`
   - Reverses the characters in a given string.

6. **Palindrome Check**
   - Function: `is_palindrome(s)`
   - Checks if a given string reads the same backward as forward.

7. **Leap Year Check**
   - Function: `is_leap_year(year)`
   - Determines if a given year is a leap year.

8. **Armstrong Number Check**
   - Function: `is_armstrong_number(n)`
   - Checks if a given number is an Armstrong number.

9. **Custom Encryption-Decryption System**
   - Functions: `caesar_encrypt(message, shift)` and `caesar_decrypt(encrypted_message, shift)`
   - Implements a Caesar cipher for encrypting and decrypting messages.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Python-Internship-Task1.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Python-Internship-Task1
   ```
3. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python task1.py
   ```

## Examples
Here are a few examples of the outputs you can expect:

- **Sum of Two Numbers:**
  ```
  Sum of 3 and 5: 8
  Sum of -2 and 7: 5
  ```

- **Odd or Even Check:**
  ```
  Number 4 is: Even
  Number 7 is: Odd
  ```

- **Factorial Calculation:**
  ```
  Factorial of 5: 120
  Factorial of 0: 1
  ```

- **Custom Encryption-Decryption System:**
  ```
  Encrypted message: KhoorZruog
  Decrypted message: HelloWorld
  ```
