# Python Tasks

This repository contains Python implementations for various algorithmic problems. Each task is designed to help enhance problem-solving skills and understanding of key programming concepts.

## Tasks Covered

### 1. Find All Permutations of a String
- Generates all permutations of a given string.
- Utilizes recursion and itertools.
- Example cases included.

### 2. N-th Fibonacci Number (Dynamic Programming)
- Computes the N-th Fibonacci number efficiently.
- Uses a bottom-up dynamic programming approach.

### 3. Find Duplicates in a List
- Identifies all duplicate elements in a given list.
- Uses a dictionary (Counter) to count occurrences.

### 4. Longest Increasing Subsequence
- Finds the length of the longest increasing subsequence in an array.
- Uses dynamic programming.

### 5. Find K Largest Elements
- Retrieves the `k` largest elements from a list.
- Uses a heap (nlargest function).

### 6. Rotate Matrix
- Rotates a given 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise.
- Uses transposition and row reversal.

### 7. Sudoku Validator
- Validates whether a given Sudoku board configuration is correct.
- Checks rows, columns, and 3x3 grids for duplicates.

### 8. Virtual Stock Market Simulator
- Simulates a stock trading system.
- Users can buy, sell, and track stocks with random price fluctuations.
- Implements data structures to manage portfolios and transactions.

## Running the Code
- Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
- Run the script using:
  ```bash
  python filename.py
  ```
- The script includes test cases to verify the functionality of each task.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- No external libraries are required; all solutions use built-in Python modules.
